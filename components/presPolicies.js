        healthcare: 'Joe Biden proposes protecting and building on the Affordable Care Act instead of switching to a Medicare for All system.\nBiden\'s campaign website says about the Affordable Care Act: "Because of Obamacare, over 100 million people no longer have to worry that an insurance company will deny coverage or charge higher premiums just because they have a pre-existing condition – whether cancer or diabetes or heart disease or a mental health challenge. Insurance companies can no longer set annual or lifetime limits on coverage. Roughly 20 million additional Americans obtained the peace of mind that comes with health insurance. Young people who are in transition from school to a job have the option to stay covered by their parents’ plan until age 26. But, every day over the past nine years, the Affordable Care Act has been under relentless attack. As president, Biden will protect the Affordable Care Act from these continued attacks. He opposes every effort to get rid of this historic law – including efforts by Republicans, and efforts by Democrats. Instead of starting from scratch and getting rid of private insurance, he has a plan to build on the Affordable Care Act by giving Americans more choice, reducing health care costs, and making our health care system less complex to navigate.\" Biden also wrote in a Medium post that he would lower the Medicare eligibility age to 60.',

        labor: 'Joe Biden\'s campaign website says, "Strong unions built the great American middle class. Everything that defines what it means to live a good life and know you can take care of your family – the 40 hour work week, paid leave, health care protections, a voice in your workplace – is because of workers who organized unions and fought for worker protections. Because of organizing and collective bargaining, there used to be a basic bargain between workers and their employers in this country that when you work hard, you share in the prosperity your work created."\nHis website continues, "As president, Biden will: Check the abuse of corporate power over labor and hold corporate executives personally accountable for violations of labor laws.

        gunRegulation: 'Donald Trump\'s campaign website says, "The Second Amendment to our Constitution is clear. The right of the people to keep and bear Arms shall not be infringed upon. Gun and magazine bans are a total failure. The right of self-defense doesn’t stop at the end of your driveway. That’s why I have a concealed carry permit and why tens of millions of Americans do too. That permit should be valid in all 50 states."',
        healthcare: 'Donald Trump\'s campaign website says, "President Trump has worked to improve access to affordable quality health care.

        criminalJustice: 'Howie Hawkins\' campaign website lists the following positions on criminal and civil justice: "Monitor and Prosecute White Racist Terrorists. Federal Investigations of Local Police Misconduct. Community Control of the Police. End Mass Incarceration—Treat Drug Abuse as a Health Problem, Not a Criminal Problem. Legalize Marijuana. Decriminalize Personal Possession of Hard Drugs. Drug Treatment on Demand. Decriminalize Sex Work. Fight Corporate Crime. End Warrantless Mass Surveillance. Pardon Whistle Blowers and Political Prisoners.',
        economy: 'Howie Hawkins\' campaign website says, "We will never reverse extreme and growing economic inequality as long as capitalists exploit workers for profit and extract more unearned income from the economy as rent and interest. Capitalists pay workers a fixed wage and take the rest of the value workers’ labor creates as profit. Capitalists take more unearned income as rent and interest in excess of the costs of production due to their exclusive ownership of access to resources, such as land sites, natural resources, intellectual property, and monopolies."',
        education : 'Howie Hawkins\' campaign website says, "First, educational policy should be made primarily by teachers and parents through locally elected school boards. Mayoral and state control of schools have become a way of closing public schools and imposing educational policies, especially charter school privatization, from the top down. Local parents and teachers have more interest in good local schools than top-down administrators."\nHis website continues, "Second, we must end high-stakes testing, which has reduced education to teaching to the test. It punishes students, teachers, and schools in high-poverty school districts simply for being poor. The punishment is often school closures or privatization into charters. High-stakes testing is the front edge of the charter school privatization agenda. High-stakes testing takes away from the many other qualities that should be developed by an education, including intellectual self-confidence, creativity, critical thinking, problem solving, teamwork, and tolerance."',
        energyAndEnvironment: 'Howie Hawkins\' campaign website says, "We will never reverse pending planetary environmental collapse as long as we have a capitalist economy where competition for profits drives the blind, relentless growth that is consuming the environment, heating up the planet, and destroying ecological foundations of human civilization."',
        foreignPolicy: 'Howie Hawkins\' campaign website says, "I will also center our ecosocialist Green New Deal on the third existential threat: nuclear war. Capitalism’s competitive economic structure yields a conflict-ridden international system that generates endless wars. Sooner or later, wars will lead to nuclear annihilation if we don’t change the system and abolish nuclear weapons. An enduring peace requires replacing capitalism with ecosocialism—capitalism’s nationalistic competitive militarism with ecosocialism’s international cooperative security. We will call for deep US military spending cuts and converting to a defensive military posture from today’s global military empire of over 800 foreign military bases. The savings will be a peace dividend to reinvest in a Global Green New Deal for economic human rights, clean energy, and regenerative agriculture around the world. The United States can make friends instead of enemies by using its wealth to be the world’s humanitarian superpower instead of its imperialist superpower. We will call for a recommitment to the recently abandoned arms treaties and to vigorous new negotiations for further reductions toward complete nuclear disarmament and for scaling back the world’s militaries to strictly defensive forces. We will oppose US military intervention for regime change and speak up for human rights wherever they are violated."',
        gunRegulation: 'Howie Hawkins\' campaign website lists some of the following gun regulation policies: "Ban and buy back military assault weapons, high-capacity magazines, and bump stocks. Universal background checks for gun and ammunition buyers, including closing the loophole for private sales and sales at gun shows, with sales and background check records maintained indefinitely in a central registry. Require all gun owners to pass a gun safety test, a visual test, and be licensed by a government agency, similar to the requirements for obtaining a driver’s license. Institute a 28-day waiting period after license application before firearms can be possessed. Expand the prohibition on the purchase and possession of guns by people convicted of misdemeanor domestic violence crimes to include people convicted of menacing, assault, or unlawful imprisonment."',
        healthcare: 'Howie Hawkins\' campaign website says, "A community-controlled national health service, delivering services largely through publicly owned clinics and hospitals employing salaried staff, and governed by a federation of locally-elected boards, will provide better accountability and cost control than a top-down Medicare-like national health insurance system paying mostly private providers to deliver health services."',
        immigration : 'Howie Hawkins\' campaign website says, "The inhumanity of US immigration policy came to broad public attention in 2018 with the news coverage of forced separations of young children from their families on the southern US border. These crimes against humanity only underscored the long-standing brutality of US immigration policy, which has treated people from Mexico and Central America in particular as cheap labor to be imported or deported based on US labor demand, like apartheid South Africa once used Bantustans."\nHis website continues, "We will demand open borders where movement between nations is free, like it is in the European Union. International borders should be authentic fair-trade zones where people are free to travel across borders for work, shopping, or recreation. The status of undocumented immigrants should be legalized and provide a timely path to citizenship. People crossing international borders would be required to present their identification at a border crossing. Only people wanted for criminal charges or terrorist organization affiliation would be detained. People who cross without checking in at a border crossing would also be detained and checked at an official border crossing. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and Customs and Border Protection (BPE) should be abolished and replaced with a new immigration agency with personnel committed to the open borders policy."',
        impeachment: 'Howie Hawkins\' campaign website says, "From the moment Trump took office, he has been receiving payments from foreign and domestic governments and lobbyists at his properties in violation of the foreign and domestic emoluments clauses of the Constitution. He is the unindicted co-conspirator in the felony hush-money campaign finance case where his underling, Michael Cohen, was convicted and is now serving time. Trump unlawfully told border agents and Homeland Security officials to break immigration laws and defy judicial orders concerning border crossings, asylum seekers, and child separations. He told a group of police officers to be more violent with suspects and the cops cheered him. He told American Indian leaders to break laws to frack and drill for oil and gas on their lands in violation of federal laws. We could go describing many other high crimes and misdemeanors or the 29 current investigations that prosecutors and Congress are finally doing on Trump’s 40-year rap sheet of alleged crimes that encompass everything from multiple sexual assaults to a multitude of corporate crimes, including tax evasion, bank fraud, insurance fraud, money laundering, and wage theft. The grounds for impeaching Trump are a target-rich environment."',

Finally, I will work to repeal laws and regulations that prevent individuals and charitable organizations from helping those in need.”',

In the forty years since the Department of Education was created, government spending on education has skyrocketed, while the quality of education has declined.

Their latest proposals to ‘fix’ health care will further micromanage your doctors and restrict your access to care while failing to solve the underlying problem. They differ only on whether this should be done by private insurance companies or government bureaucrats. This is the exact opposite of what needs to be done.

This will make health care affordable for most Americans, while also reducing the cost of legacy programs like Medicare, Medicaid, and the VA.”',
